# The Dynamics of a Two-Level Atom using Quantum Monte Carlo


This project investigates the dynamics of a simple two-level atom using a formalism of quantum mechanics that introduces the notion of random evolutions of the state vectors of a system. Over many realizations this method is shown to be successful in simulating the systems that will be investigated. The algorithm is first shown to simulate the simple case of a relaxing atom in a thermal cavity well. It is then applied to a system consisting of driven two-level atom undergoing spontaneous emission. Here, the algorithm also succeeds in providing insights into the anti-bunching phenomena occurring
